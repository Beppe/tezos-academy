# Chapter 2 : Types

LIGO is a strongly and statically typed language. This means that the compiler checks how your contract processes data. If it passes the test, your contract will not fail at run-time due to inconsistent assumptions on your data. This is called type checking.

## Built-in types

LIGO comes with all basic types built-in like _string_, _int_ or _tez_ for account balance or monetary transactions. You can find all built-in types on <a href="https://gitlab.com/ligolang/ligo/-/blob/dev/src/environment/environment.ml" target="_blank">the LIGO gitlab</a>.

## Type aliases

Type aliasing consists in renaming a given type, when the context calls for a more precise name. This increases readability and maintainability of your smart contracts. For example we can choose to alias a string type as an animal breed - this will allow us to communicate our intent with added clarity.

```
type breed = string
let dog_breed : breed = "Saluki"
```

## Simple types

The type account_balances denotes a map from addresses to tez

```
type account_balances =  (address, tez) map

let ledger : account_balances =
Map.literal [(("tz1KqTpEZ7Yob7QbPE4Hy4Wo8fHG8LhKxZSx" : address), 10mutez)]

```

ℹ️  We will look more deeply into the _map_ construct in the following chapters.

## Structured types

Often contracts require complex data structures, which in turn require well-typed storage or functions to work with. LIGO offers a simple way to compose simple types into structured types.
The first of those structured types is the record, which aggregates types as fields and index them with a field name. In the example below we define an account type which keeps the balance and number of previous transactions for a given account.

```
type account = {
  balance : tez;
  transactions : nat
}

let my_account : account = {
    balance = 10mutez;
    transactions = 5n
}
```

## Your mission

<!-- prettier-ignore -->1- There is an online editor in the top right corner of this page. In the editor, define *ship\_code* as a string type.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->2- Then define the constant *my\_ship* as a *ship\_code* of value _"020433"_.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->3- Then go ahead and validate your mission for a comparative view with the solution.
